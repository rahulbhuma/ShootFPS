    bulletPoints:
    - The camera constraints aimer for full body characters no longer constrains
      the camera rotation to the weapon. Rotation is now handled like the weapon
      move aimer, where the weapon is aligned to the camera instead. The position
      is still handled by constraining camera to weapon as before. This means you
      always keep the screen centered on your target when entering/exiting ADS
